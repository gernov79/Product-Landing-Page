          Pilsner is a beer style that originated in Pilsen (Plzeň), a city in
          western Bohemia. It was first brewed in 1842, making it one of the
          youngest beer styles to appear in modern brewing. The style originated
          when the citizens of Pilsen, who grew unhappy with the quality of the
          beer, decided to build Bürger Brauerei (Citizens' Brewery), which
          would later become Pilsner Urquell.
        </p>
        <p>
          They eventually brought a Bavarian brewmaster Josef Groll—who went to
          create the first pilsner brew. Although the initial idea was to create
          a Bavarian-style lager, the use of Czech ingredients influenced the
          emergence of a new style. The original pilsner, which was one of the
          first versions of a clear, light-colored beer, was made with light
          malted barley from Moravia and Saaz hops.
        </p>
        <p>
          The style was soon imitated across the world, with varying results.
          Nowadays, the official classifications divide the style into two main
          regional categories: Bohemian and German pilsner. Despite slight
          differences in style and numerous imitations around the world, the
          best pilsner examples will be crisp and refreshing, with a dominant
          hop character.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Czech Republic, only beer from Pilsen is referred to as
          pilsner, while in Germany, the name that is most commonly used for
          pilsner brews is pils.
